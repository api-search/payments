        Don’t use search in read-after-write flows where strict consistency is
        necessary. Under normal operating

        conditions, data is searchable in less than a minute. Occasionally,
        propagation of new or updated data can be up

        to an hour behind during outages. Search functionality is not available
        to merchants in India.</p>
