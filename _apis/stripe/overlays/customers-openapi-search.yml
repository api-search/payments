        Don’t use search in read-after-write flows where strict consistency is
        necessary. Under normal operating

        conditions, data is searchable in less than a minute. Occasionally,
        propagation of new or updated data can be up

        to an hour behind during outages. Search functionality is not available
        to merchants in India.</p>

        <p>Updates the specified customer by setting the values of the
        parameters passed. Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged.
        For example, if you pass the <strong>source</strong> parameter, that
        becomes the customer’s active source (e.g., a card) to be used for all
        charges in the future. When you update a customer to a new valid card
        source by passing the <strong>source</strong> parameter: for each of the
        customer’s current subscriptions, if the subscription bills
        automatically and is in the <code>past_due</code> state, then the latest
        open invoice for the subscription with automatic collection enabled will
        be retried. This retry will not count as an automatic retry, and will
        not affect the next regularly scheduled payment for the invoice.
        Changing the <strong>default_source</strong> for a customer will not
        trigger this behavior.</p>


        <p>This request accepts mostly the same arguments as the customer
        creation call.</p>

      description: >-
        <p>Cancels a customer’s subscription. If you set the
        <code>at_period_end</code> parameter to <code>true</code>, the
        subscription will remain active until the end of the period, at which
        point it will be canceled and not renewed. Otherwise, with the default
        <code>false</code> value, the subscription is terminated immediately. In
        either case, the customer will not be charged again for the
        subscription.</p>


        <p>Note, however, that any pending invoice items that you’ve created
        will still be charged for at the end of the period, unless manually <a
        href="#delete_invoiceitem">deleted</a>. If you’ve set the subscription
        to cancel at the end of the period, any pending prorations will also be
        left in place and collected at the end of the period. But if the
        subscription is set to cancel immediately, pending prorations will be
        removed.</p>


        <p>By default, upon subscription cancellation, Stripe will stop
        automatic collection of all finalized invoices for the customer. This is
        intended to prevent unexpected payment attempts after the customer has
        canceled a subscription. However, you can resume automatic collection of
        the invoices manually after subscription cancellation to have us
        proceed. Or, you could check for unpaid invoices before allowing the
        customer to cancel the subscription at all.</p>
